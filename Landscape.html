            <p class="mt-5 text-secondary">We believe that landscape and architectural design are meant to come together
                as integrated as well as opposing elements. It is this contradiction between the two that enriches the
                experience of the other. Landscape design is not a garden to be merely observed. It is a part of the
                house or building, an extension of the inside, often a room without walls. It enlivens the architecture,
                it creates variety in design depending on the regional and local context. Often for the landscape to
                make a dramatic impact bold interventions are needed in the initial conceptual planning and thought
                process of the project. What may in the end seem natural is often the outcome of surprisingly intensive
                interventions.</p>

                <p>The Ray Villa in Alibag emphasises on the profile of the built form in relation to the hilltop
                    property overlooking the Mumbai bay. Two staggered linear pavilion-like structures, directed towards
                    the view, define the character of the house. They are strong manifestations that act as long spatial
                    telescopes, bringing the distant sea views seemingly closer by.</p>

                <h6>House on a Stream</h6>
                <p>With a stream running through the house, this retreat in Alibag delicately weaves into the landscape.
                    It alternately opens up and closes itself to the different characteristics of the site. The house is
                    like an organism trying to make most use of its resources and surroundings. With its several limbs,
                    it reaches out into the landscape. Each “limb” makes full use of the views within the site and
                    dramatizes special moments.</p>

                    The top of a vegetated roof merges with the top of the hillock, hiding the house while approaching.
                    A bamboo screen surrounding a deep verandah causes an ever-changing pattern of light and shadow
                    throughout the seasons and times of the day, making the Riparian House a ‘sensor’ of light.</p>

                <p>The Carter Road SkatePark adds a vibrant and refreshing new public space to the city of Bombay. It
                    has brought together old and young, beginners and experienced skaters as well. Being the the first
                    skate park in Bombay it has played an important role in attracting new skaters to help grow the

                <p>The House in a Beach Garden used to be segregated from its seafront by a tall boundary wall, It
                    separated the property both physically and visually from the much coveted coastline of the Mumbai
                    bay. A missed opportunity. Therefore the first and most important intervention was to lift the
                    garden up 5 feet above the existing level, such that the house, the garden and the top of the
                    boundary wall, were all aligned in one level.</p>

                <p>The Vanavihari Eco Resorts are a commendable initiative undertaken by the Andhra Pradesh government.
                    aimed at spreading awareness of the natural environment among travellers. The forest cabins will be
                    located within the natural forest. Since the scenic streams and ponds at the forest reserves attract
                    arboreal and bird wildlife, they make for ideal locations for forest cabins as observatories.</p>

                <p>The yoga retreat is conceptualised as an extrusion of its terraced Himalayan landscape. One could
                    imagine that an incidental geological formation pushed up a section of the terraces in the shape of
                    a malformed asymmetrical three winged boomerang. Underneath, above and between the ground plane and
                    the roof, the yoga retreat is a device to experience the landscape in diverse ways.</p>

                    the mountain top. These underground dwellings focus like telescopes to the surrounding views. A
                    staircase gently slopes, as an earth block sculpture, from the plateau in the direction of the homes

                    than that. It is a continuation of the challenge course of the Magic Bus Outdoor Learning Campus.

                    visitors to enter it, and live an experience which is architectural as much as artistic and
                    environmental, letting nature and the movements of water express the pattern of time on the
