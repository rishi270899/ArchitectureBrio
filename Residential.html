            <p class="mt-5 text-secondary">At Architecture BRIO, each house we design is a bespoke solution. They
                are the result of a
                comprehensive
                understanding of the clients brief, location, topography or context. </p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-secondary">Our design process starts with asking the right questions. By formulating
                a variety of ideas
                on the
                project, conversations with the project team, and a thorough understanding of the site, we select
                the
                best ideas from the many potential possibilities and approaches. Hence the design of each house
                undergoes a rigorous back and forth process. We emphasise on going through this process together
                with
                our clients and collaborators. This ensures that the chosen approach is as much suited to their
                needs as
                it befitting the site. Even in residential projects, we believe that architecture is a public art,
                regardless of whether it is situated in a public, urban or rural context.</p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-secondary">In our work, humble, natural materials an inexpensive resources feel
                tailored and precious.
                Finely crafted details enhance the tactile and visual sensitivity of the design. Our architecture is
                simple, uses ample natural light and ventilation and integrates both physically and visually with
                the
                landscape. Minimising the use of un-renewable energy sources and working towards a sustainable
                future is
                equally important.</p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-secondary">We look at residential architecture as a back drop to daily life, rather
                than becoming the
                centre stage. Architecture is therefore a tool to enhance the everyday experience of daily life.
                Nevertheless, our clients’ goals in each project may be different; whether it is to be closer to
                nature,
                enjoy its mere functionality or appreciate the touch and feel of well crafted details and materials.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-secondary">
                Our residential projects are situated in diverse climates. They range from the cold climate of the
                Himalayas to the tropical southern Konkan coast and beyond. Conscious of this diversity we offer
                localised sustainable solutions for each. We help our clients uncovering the latent potential and
                character of their property. Since we work in these varied geographic and climatic conditions, our
                projects are able to reveal the unique quality of each particular context.

                <p>House of Galleries is designed around an unconventional courtyard space with a sculpted landscape,
                    and draws inspiration from a short movie including snips of Iranian films, artists and photographers
                    works of art. These images, together with the exceptional natural context of the Rann of Kutch,
                    became catalysts in shaping the unique home with long, experiential walks through one space to
                    another, elevating the site itself as a museum.</p>

                <h6>Casa Brio – Apartment</h6>
                <p>Bandra was once a leafy suburb of Mumbai city. In recent times it has become a vibrant yet highly
                    dense neighbourhood, symptomatic of the crunching space in Indian metropolises. As a result, the
                    floor space of an average household gets more and more constrained and precious. This increasing
                    problem has been ingeniously addressed in a 7th floor apartment in Bandra.</p>

                <p>Built within a beautiful palm plantation, the 30-year old humble structure with four thick walls and
                    small windows seemed unresponsive towards its context. The refurbishment of the house starts with a
                    new imagination of the space, one that is permeable, and pertinent to the surroundings. By reducing
                    the house down to the structure and removing internal walls, the house starts to breath and gets a
                    new life.</p>

                <p>The House in a Beach Garden used to be segregated from its seafront by a tall boundary wall, It
                    separated the property both physically and visually from the much coveted coastline of the Mumbai
                    bay. A missed opportunity. Therefore the first and most important intervention was to lift the
                    garden up 5 feet above the existing level, such that the house, the garden and the top of the
                    boundary wall, were all aligned in one level.</p>

                    imagine that an incidental geological formation pushed up a section of the terraces in the shape of
                    a malformed asymmetrical three winged boomerang. Underneath, above and between the ground plane and
                    the roof, the yoga retreat is a device to experience the landscape in diverse ways.</p>

                <h6>BillionBricks Homes</h6>
                <p>BillionBricks Homes is the world’s first carbon negative, self financing home for the homeless. It
                    address the scarcity of homes across rural communities and the impossibility of access to financing.
                    It is a radical concept in housing designed for ‘energy sufficiency’ and ‘extreme affordability’.
                    The structure of the house is built in an indigenous prefab assembly technique that makes it easy to
                    assemble in remote locations.</p>

                    the contour on the upper level. One pavilion faces the view of a nearby reserved forest. Another
                    settles in the middle of a pear and peach orchard. The ensemble of structures act as an extensive

                    The top of a vegetated roof merges with the top of the hillock, hiding the house while approaching.
                    A bamboo screen surrounding a deep verandah causes an ever-changing pattern of light and shadow
