            <h5 class="b">Interior</h5>
            <p class="mt-5 text-secondary">Architecture BRIO has been involved in the interior design of several high
                end residential apartments. Our interior design services include complete solutions from architectural
                space planning to the softer touches that go into making a home.</p>

            <p class=" text-secondary">Our residential interiors aim to enhance and add value to the home owners
                life. In order to achieve this, we first visualise with our clients how they live. But perhaps more
                importantly we imagine, with them, what different possibilities their new abode could offer. Hereafter,
                through thorough planning, we derive at a suitable space plan that opens up these possibilities of
                living.</p>

            <p class=" text-secondary">In interior design, the initial planning and selection process is equally, if
                not more important than the construction process. An extensive design and planning stage facilitates a
                control over project budgets. Furthermore it allows the execution process to follow uninterruptedly.
                With a thorough integration of services such as lighting, air conditioning and home automation, the
                homes become a seamless extension to everyday life.</p>

            <p class=" text-secondary">In compact spaces, we aim to create impactful spaces that can do more than
                one thing. Spaces should have the ability to hide the daily clutter for a serene ambience, but they
                should also be able to accommodate multiple activities simultaneously. Bespoke built in furniture pieces
                in open living concepts accommodate a variety of different functions that can open up when needed.</p>

            <p class=" text-secondary">In more generous apartments, we revel in the challenge to develop a rich
                spatial experience. A more compartmentalised series of rooms has the opportunity to create unique and
                diverse interiors that reflect the lives of those who live in them. At the same time, a choreography of
                movement builds up an experiential quality of anticipation that tie the interiors together.</p>

            <p class=" text-secondary">We believe in using good quality materials, whether they are of high value or
                of humble origin. We prefer using solid materials that can be crafted and sculpted. Good quality
                hardware makes the operation of everyday items seamless. Finishes should age well and add character to
                the home over time. These are all important to our design ideology and aesthetic sensibility.</p>

                <h6>Tala Treehouse Villa</h6>
                <p>The Treehouse Villa perches on the cliff of a 160 acre hilltop ‘treesort’ property surrounded by a
                    meandering river landscape. The idyllic setting in Tala on the West coast of India, is a stone’s
                    throw away from the Kuda caves. The Treehouse Villa is conceived as a celebration of this forested
                    tropical setting with one main voluminous glazed space below a dominating thatched roof.</p>

                    areas of the lower level of the urban green home as a more fluid space. Spaces extend into each

                <h6>Casa Brio – Apartment</h6>
                <p>Bandra was once a leafy suburb of Mumbai city. In recent times it has become a vibrant yet highly
                    dense neighbourhood, symptomatic of the crunching space in Indian metropolises. As a result, the
                    floor space of an average household gets more and more constrained and precious. This increasing
                    problem has been ingeniously addressed in a 7th floor apartment in Bandra.</p>

                <h6>Spiral Dollhouse</h6>
                <p>The Spiral Dollhouse is a hybrid between a 1/6 scale version of an imaginary house, an architectural
                    model, and a barbie doll diorama. You can view the three storied house and play with it from all
                    four sides. The rooms are organised in a spiral and turn around the central core. Voids in the
                    floors and openings in the core encourage interaction and play in between the rooms, vertically,
                    horizontally and diagonally.</p>

                <h6>Duplex Apartment DNNW</h6>
                <p>Increasingly disheartened by the vanishing views and light the client used to have from their hilltop
                    bungalow in south Mumbai, they opted for a dramatic lifestyle change. They moved into a duplex
                    apartment on one of the top floors of the 60 storey luxury apartment building that hovered above
                    their bungalow. This would allow them to once again enjoy the dramatic views over the Arabian Sea.
