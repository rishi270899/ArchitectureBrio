            <p class="mt-5 text-secondary">Collaborations with NGOâ€™s has given us the opportunity to work on Educational
                buildings. These projects are often met with very strict budgets and standards. As a result of this, we
                constantly negotiate program to create other points of interest. For example, we do this by adding
                elements of play or non program items. Consequently this enables users to enjoy the experience of the
                building in different ways. It is these non-program items that make the building more than just an
                educational institute. As a result of these elements, the building is able to create new learning
                opportunities for children or its users.</p>

            <p class=" text-secondary">The needs of educational institutes is constantly changing. From teaching
                methods, to multi use of
                classrooms. Flexibility is key in the design of these buildings. It has to not only respond to the
                current needs of the program but also foreseeable needs of the future. To allow for the building to
                expand and adapt, the design of the structure needs to enable this.</p>

            <p class="text-secondary">We enhance the learning environment by giving the building a sense of identity and
                community. Spaces are open to interpretation and adaptation. The success in the design of our
                educational buildings has been in that they give the end user a sense of pride and ownership.</p>

            <p class="text-secondary">We place immense value in the inputs of end users, staff and collaborators. By
                designing intelligently even modest budgets can go a long way.</p>
