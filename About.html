                <h5>Dean D’Cruz-</h5>
                <p> A graduate from J. J. college of architecture, Mumbai, set up practice in Goa in 1989, continuing
                    to co-found Mozaic Design architectural wing in 2001. Sustainability has been at the core of his
                    design ethos, gradually gaining shape and recognition with the urgency of climate change since 2012.
                    He has conducted numerous workshops and seminars on architecture, planning and environment, with
                    works and articles published in leading magazines in India and abroad. With his interest in
                    collaborations, he has supported the Royal Institute of Art, Stockholm, Oxford Brookes University
                    UK, and PRATT Institute New York with architectural and planning programs in Goa.
                    Having designed over 250 houses, 50 hotels, 30 housing complexes, 30 institutions, offices and
                    factories, Dean is recipient of multiple awards. His strength today is in the hospitality industry,
                    from boutique hotels and jungle lodges to 200+ room resorts. His current efforts are aimed at
                    improving academic standards across the country through awareness of criteria that address
                    environmental and social issues in architecture and planning; all made possible through workshops,
                    master classes and his presence as a jury member on a large number of award platforms.</p>

                <h5>Reboni Saha-</h5>
                <p>Graduated in the field of Industrial Design in 1994 from National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. She
                    heads the product design section of Mozaic as co-founder, and believes that a blend of architecture,
                    interiors and industrial design set practical criteria for good design. This informs design at a
                    more holistic level and has been responsible for her successes, from fans to washers to lighting
                    systems.
                    Reboni helped set up the appliance design section of IFB Industries, while working with Crompton
                    Greaves Electricals for their lighting and fan divisions. Her design experience has covered cabins
                    and interiors for Indian Railways through Kineco Industries, capital goods such as blow molding
                    machines for Sidel, hospitality and experience design with Taj Hotels.
                    She has also leaned heavily into social design projects, having designed a moving school, areca nut
                    leaf tableware and wooden toys for local carpenter’s cooperatives.
                    Business World India magazine, Inside Outside, Index Furniture Journal as well as CNBC India, have
                    featured her work. https://youtu.be/IY650tFHm70</p>

                <p>Architecture BRIO engages actively in the creation of contextually appropriate, sustainable design
                    solutions within an increasingly changing world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The work of the studio addresses new ways of understanding the often contradictory interrelations
                    between the city, architecture, landscape, and the world of interiors. There is a growing need for
                    our built environment to re-establish healthy relationships with the natural world. Similarly there
                    is an urgency to address the never before seen growth in urban and rural areas in India and
                    globally. Within this context, the work searches for a delicate balance between architecture as the
                    act of disappearance, and creating characterful, responsive and experiential environments.</p>
                <img src="https://www.architecturebrio.com/wp-content/uploads/Office/brio_office-conceptual-diagram.jpg"
                    alt="" >

                <p>Over ten years later, Architecture BRIO’s work field spans a vast variety of cultures, climates and
                    landscapes across the Indian Subcontinent and South East Asia. The project portfolio has an emphasis
                    on residential design of private houses and weekend homes where the architectural challenge and the
                    opportunity to innovate is extensive. However the studio brings more and more their hands on
                    experience and attention to detailing to hospitality, educational, humanitarian design , as well as
                    cultural and institutional projects. An architectural project is never an isolated exercise.
                    Therefore interior design and landscape design are natural extensions of the practice and often core
                    services for projects as well.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Each project is seen as a challenge. But it also is an opportunity to uncover the unique
                    characteristics of these specific conditions. It becomes an opportunity to investigate which
                    intervention has a potential for positive change. We often ask ourselves which approach can have an
                    impact on the way we deal with our natural and built. However appropriateness is not necessarily the
                    most self evident. Often an inherent conflict between the context and climate of a project and its
                    chosen typological and functional approach, generates solutions that unexpectedly turn out to be
                    favourable solutions

                </p>

                    alt="" >
                <p>The practice believes that there is a need to promote rapid, widespread acceptance of sustainable
                    solutions. However, the challenge is to generate fresh ideas that carry out self-sufficient systems
                    at scale. The potentials of new building techniques, re-appropriating materials in an effective and
                    durable way, and intelligent energy concepts should be uncovered and integrated in an innovative way
                    in architecture. With energy reduction and sustainability as a starting point the practice attempts
                    to create innovative and exciting architecture. BRIO, much like the name, is about buildings that
                    give energy both literally and metaphorically. It is therefore about inspiring and make people
                    happy.
