                institutional and cultural projects. The first step in the design process is usually, the formulation of
                the project brief together with our collaborators. This is done through research and enquiry. The
                program and use of the building is designed keeping in mind multiple end users.</p>

            <p class="mt-1 text-secondary">Institutional and cultural projects enable us to contribute to society and
                the public realm through design . The driving force for the design of institutional and cultural
                buildings, is often, an extension of the ideologies of the institutional or cultural body.</p>

            <p class="mt-1 text-secondary">Experimental use of materials and technology often accompanies the design of
                these buildings. The buildings get a distinctive character from the quality of its spaces and the
                materials used.</p>

            <p class="mt-1 text-secondary">Sustainable practices of construction as well as use of renewable resources
                accompanies the design of the buildings from the initial thought process.

                    tendril legs on a flower barely touching what it feeds on, so the interventions in this sensitive
                    ecological landscape are designed to reduce the interference with the site.</p>

                    cycle lane and crosses the entire length of the ecological basin. It creates a void that calls the
                    visitors to enter it, and live an experience which is architectural as much as artistic and
                    environmental, letting nature and the movements of water express the pattern of time on the
                    installation.</p>
