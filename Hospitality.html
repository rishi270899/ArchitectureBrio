            <h5 class="b">Hospitality</h5>
            <p class="mt-5 text-secondary">At the start of our careers we have worked on several hospitality design
                projects in Sri Lanka. Therefore, this has influenced the approach and stand we take in the design of
                these. We believe in looking for unconventional solutions that go beyond the norm. It is essential to
                push the boundaries in hospitality design in order to create memorable experiences that refresh the body
                and mind.</p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-secondary">Design of hotels or boutique home-stays requires an equal measure of
                efficiency to make experiences seamless and enjoyable. Together with an experienced group of consultants
                we ensure that these projects are thorough in their planning and expertise. Combining functionality and
                creativity is the key to our approach to hospitality design.</p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-secondary">By using natural materials, alternative construction methods, sustainable
                technologies, we push the boundaries of hospitality design to create meaningful experiences between the
                user and building.

                <h6>Bouillon Nature Retreat</h6>
                <p>This nature retreat located in the heart of the Ardennes forests in the south of Belgium reflects the
                    combination of local heritage and contemporary architecture. Four storey stone tower provides unique
                    experience and magnificent views towards surrounding nature.</p>

                    the contour on the upper level. One pavilion faces the view of a nearby reserved forest. Another
                    settles in the middle of a pear and peach orchard. The ensemble of structures act as an extensive
                    photographic device, capturing the constantly changing dynamics of the Himalayan mountainscape.</p>

                    meandering river landscape. The idyllic setting in Tala on the West coast of India, is a stone’s
                    throw away from the Kuda caves. The Treehouse Villa is conceived as a celebration of this forested
                    tropical setting with one main voluminous glazed space below a dominating thatched roof.</p>

                <h6>Forest Eco Resort</h6>
                <p>The Vanavihari Eco Resorts are a commendable initiative undertaken by the Andhra Pradesh government.
                    aimed at spreading awareness of the natural environment among travellers. The forest cabins will be
                    located within the natural forest. Since the scenic streams and ponds at the forest reserves attract
                    arboreal and bird wildlife, they make for ideal locations for forest cabins as observatories.</p>

                <h6>Dharamshala Yoga Retreat</h6>
                <p>The yoga retreat is conceptualised as an extrusion of its terraced Himalayan landscape. One could
                    imagine that an incidental geological formation pushed up a section of the terraces in the shape of
                    a malformed asymmetrical three winged boomerang. Underneath, above and between the ground plane and
                    the roof, the yoga retreat is a device to experience the landscape in diverse ways.</p>

                    on its north side, while displaying incredible views of the Mukteshwar Valley on its south. The
                    cabin is a cantilever Y shape building and holds all the necessary facilities for a mountain rustic
                    experience. It is self sufficient in terms of water and electricity, thanks to solar panels and

                    with interconnected ponds and waterbodies. Five proposed waterbodies accommodate 16 holiday homes
                    and a boat house. The homes are clustered as stilted pavilions; sometimes on the land and sometimes

                <p>Forest Hills is a quiet picturesque retreat tucked away amidst dense foliage and trees, perching high
                    on top of a mountain overlooking an estuary. Here, 8 underground “cave homes” will be carved into
                    the mountain top. These underground dwellings focus like telescopes to the surrounding views. A
                    staircase gently slopes, as an earth block sculpture, from the plateau in the direction of the homes

                <p>The Mandwa Health Resort is envisioned as a three-dimensionally embossed landscape. It is an
                    architecture of enclosure, where walls define exterior spaces. Guests retreat in private undisturbed
                    courtyard rooms. With ivy spread across the compressed earth walls and water bodies reflecting the
                    sky, the guest rooms extend into the natural environment.</p>
